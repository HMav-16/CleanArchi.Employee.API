Complete solution for Clean architecture using .NET Core

Domain
This will contain all entities, enums, exceptions, interfaces, types and logic specific to the domain layer.

Application
This layer contains all application logic. It is dependent on the domain layer, but has no dependencies on any other layer or project. This layer defines interfaces that are implemented by outside layers. For example, if the application need to access a notification service, a new interface would be added to application and an implementation would be created within infrastructure.

Infrastructure
This layer contains classes for accessing external resources such as file systems, web services, smtp, and so on. These classes should be based on interfaces defined within the application layer.

WebApi
This layer is a web api application based on ASP.NET 6.0.x. This layer depends on both the Application and Infrastructure layers, however, the dependency on Infrastructure is only to support dependency injection. Therefore only Startup.cs should reference Infrastructure.

Clean Architecture
Clean Architecture was introduced by by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob) to provide a better way to build applications in perspective of better testability, maintainability, and dependability on the infrastructures like databases and services

Domain in center and building layer top of it. You can call it as Domain-centric Architecture too.

Though layer architectures like onion, Hexagonal all vary somewhat in their details, they are very similar. All DDD approach have the same objective, which is the separation of concerns.
